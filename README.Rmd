# About the App

This is repository is for the development and deployment of an R Shiny web application for the purpose of visualizing and exploring continuous plankton recorder (CPR) survey data.

Data for the years 1961 to 2013 were received through communications with NOAA scientists, with data from 2014-2017 received through communication with SAHFOS. Once received, zooplankton concentration data from both sources were converted to the same measurement units (number m-3), and all differences/inconsistencies in taxon identification records were compared to ensure direct matches between taxon-stage groups. The two CPR datasets were then joined to create a complete time-series covering the years 1961-2017.

The CPR Web Explorer app has several display options for viewing spatial and temporal variations in abundances for individual zooplankton taxa. 

## Spatial Distribution

## Abundance Timelines

## Seasonal Variation



# Docker Implementation

The CPR Web Explorer Application was developed in a docker environment to enable easy deployment and consistent performance. Details on the docker image configurations can be found in the `Dockerfile`.

To build and run the docker image run the following in the terminal:

 > docker build --tag gmri/bashful-badger:1.0 .   
 > docker run -p 3838:3838 --name cpr gmri/bashful-badger:1.0
